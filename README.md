![Top Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/chaunnybby7/weather-dashboard)

I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 


## Instructions 

__Step 1__: Click on `<start quiz>`
- [x] Timer is on the top right of the landing page
- [x] The countdown timer total time is 180 seconds with 12 questions
- [x] The `<view high scores>` link is on the top left of the landing page, it will redirect user to view all the high scores.  :tada:

**Step** 2: Multiple Choice Questions quiz 
- [x] If the user answered the question wrong, 10 seconds will be penalized
- [x] If the user answered the question correctly, the score will be incremented by one
- [x] Below the answers, there will be an alert message notifying the user if answer is correct or wrong. If the answer is wrong, there will be a correct answer shown. 

- **Step 3**: Game is over when all questions have been answered or if the timer reaches zero. 

**Step 4**: When the quiz ends, the user is prompted to enter name and the score will be saved to local storage after clicking the <Submit> button. 
- [x]  Sringify array in order to store in local
- [x] Create a show current highscores function
- [x] Check if there is any in local storage
- [x] <for> loop created to iterate the stored high scores and <append()> method for each round of new high score.  

- [x] **Step 5**: User can click "Reset High Scores" to clear the saved scores and click on <em>"Go Back"</em> to start quiz again.
